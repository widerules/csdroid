CSDroid (Clear Sky Droid) is an Android application for viewing and interacting with Clear Sky Charts (CSCs). CSCs are provided by, and used with permission from cleardarksky.com.

When you start CSDroid, it loads CSC data from cleardarksky.com. This can take some time depending on your network connection speed, and the speed of your device.

CSDroid has two tabs. The "closest" tab (marked with the compass) shows the closest clear sky charts to your current location. The "search" tab (marked with the magnifying glass icon) allows you to search for charts by name or location. CSCs are prefixed with a color code that gives a rough idea of the quality of upcoming forecasts.

As your location changes, the list of "closest" CSCs is updated.

Clicking on a CSC in either the closest or search tab gives the option to view CSC details, or to map the CSC. CSC details, as you might guess, shows a more detailed view of the CSC. After displaying the detailed CSC, you can click again to jump to the cleardarksky.com page for the CSC. When you choose to map the CSC, a Google maps view is opened to the location of the CSC.
